Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed
within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, version
5. 
. 
). 
 The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method32,33
within VASP was employed for all calculations. 
 2s2p states
of C; the 4d5s states of Mo and Pd; and the 5d6s states of W,
Pt, and Au were treated as valence electrons, using the default
PAW potentials in VASP to describe the nuclei and all (frozen)
core electrons. 
 employed three different exchangecorrelation (XC) functionals: the local-density approximation
(LDA),34,35 the generalized gradient approximation within the
Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) form,36 and PBE with a
reparametrization for solids (PBEsol). 

We used periodic slab models for calculating surface
properties.

 vacuum
spacing of 30 Å was used to isolate the periodic images from
each other. 
 examined the dependence of the surface
energies on slab thickness and found that nine layers of Pd, Pt,
and Au and 11 layers of WC, W2C, and Mo2C are sufficient to
converge the surface energies to an accuracy of 6 mJ/m2. 

adopted these surface slabs with converged surface energies for
subsequent work function and PZC calculations.

To calculate the bulk cohesive energy Ecoh, each of the
constituent atoms is placed in the center of a rectangular

solvent) is divided into three contributions that arise from the
electronic subsystem (solute), the liquid subsystem (solvent),
and the coupling interactions between the two subsystems. 
Each of these contributions can be dealt with at different levels
of approximations, for example Schwartz et al.

■ RESULTS
To benchmark our choice of physical models, we first compare
the lattice constants (a0, b0, and c0) of bulk Au, Pd, Pt, WC,
W2C, and Mo2C calculated using the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol
XC functionals. 
 lattice constants for each of these
materials are also listed in Table 1.

structures of hcp WC, hexagonal W2C, and orthorhombic
Mo2C, with space groups P6̅m2, P3̅1m, and Pbcn, respectively. 
Table 1 lists the theoretical lattice constants obtained with the
three XC functionals. 
 observe typical underestimation and
overestimation of most of the experimental lattice constants by
the LDA and PBE XC functionals, respectively. 
 The PBEsol
functional frequently remedies the shortcomings of the LDA
and PBE XC functionals, more often leading to the best
agreement with experimental values for the six bulk materials. 
We then computed the surface energy of the three metals
and three TMCs using the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol functionals. 
We focused on the (111) surface of the metals, the (0001)
surfaces of WC and W2C, and the (100) surface of Mo2C. 
These surfaces were selected in order to eventually compare
with their HER activities, as determined in ref 18.

 LDA functional yields
surface energies closest to experimental values for Au, Pd, and
Pt, consistent with numerous previous theoretical studies (e. 
. 

ref 60). 
 calculations for metal surfaces have shown that
the LDA functional benefits from error cancellation (overestimation of exchange is compensated for by underestimation
of correlation) while the PBE functional underestimates both
contributions. 
,62 Our results suggest that this error
cancellation also occurs for real metal surfaces such Au, Pd,
and Pt. 
 with the lattice constants, the PBEsol surface
energies lie between the LDA and PBE values, and all
functionals predict similar trends in surface energies: Pt > Pd
> Au. 
 trends are seen in the bulk cohesive
energies, Ecoh, calculated as the energy difference between a
bulk crystal unit cell and that of its constituent (isolated) atoms. 
The cohesive energy is the energy cost to break all bonds in the
bulk solid. 
 the same number of bonds are broken to
create each of the (111) surfaces of Au, Pd, and Pt, all three
functionals produce the same trend in Ecoh as for Esurf. 

cohesive energy therefore serves as a useful indicator for
expected trends in energies of analogous (same Miller index)
metal surfaces. 
We next evaluated the surface energies of the three TMCs. 
We calculated the surface energy of W- or C-terminated WC
using the same methodology adopted in our previous work on
WC.

23701surface energy of the WI-terminated surface is independent of
the W- or C-rich condition because the surface slab is
stoichiometric. 
 W2C surface with the WI-termination has
an energy that is much lower (∼1. 
 J/m2 lower) than that with
the WII termination. 
 the geometry depicted in Figure 1b,
this finding is not surprising: cleavage at the weakest, longest
bonds, the metal−metal bonds, produces this surface. 
The lowest energies of each surface computed with the three
XC functionals were extracted from Table S3 and are displayed
in Table 1. 
 experimental surface energies are not yet
available for these TMCs, our theoretical results agree well with
prior DFT values for WC17,65 and Mo2C. 
 The TMC surface
energies are predicted to be significantly higher than those of
the three elemental metals. 
 comparison is again consistent
with the much higher cohesive energies of the TMCs (Table
1). 
 metal-terminated surfaces of the three TMCs, including
the W-terminated WC, WI-terminated W2C, and Moterminated Mo2C surfaces, are all more energetically favorable
than their C-terminated counterparts. 
 henceforth refer to
these surfaces simply as the WC, W2C, and Mo2C surfaces and
base our subsequent simulations of hybrid metal monolayer−
TMC catalysts on these surfaces as substrates. 
We next computed the work function, Φ, of the three
elemental metals and the three TMCs.

calculated work function using the three XC functionals. 

results are in excellent agreement with previous calculations,
especially for the three metals calculated using the LDA and
PBE functionals. 
,67 The PBEsol functional most accurately
reproduces the work function for Au and Pd, among the three
functionals considered. 
, the calculated Φs of these two
materials are nearly identical to the experimental values
measured from photoemission. 
 contrast, the LDA functional
best reproduces the measured work function of Pt, although the
difference in pure metal work function values between all three
XC functionals is not terribly large (<0. 
 eV for all three
metals). 
Interestingly, all three XC functionals produce the same
difference of 0. 
 eV between the work function of Au and Pd. 
The predicted work function difference between Pd and Pt is
also nearly constant at ∼0. 
 eV.

trend in work function magnitude of the three metals: Pt > Pd

 that this ordering is exactly the same as the trends
in surface and cohesive energies already presented. 
 1 also
reveals that the TMC work functions are consistently predicted
to be smaller than those of the elemental metals. 
 physical
origin of this trend may be that surface dipoles present on the
metal-terminated TMC surfaces (metal atoms slightly positively
charged) decrease the energy cost to extracting the electron
from the material into the vacuum. 
The above benchmark tests of the LDA, PBE, and PBEsol
XC functionals on the bulk and surface properties of the six
conventional catalysts show that the PBEsol functional
consistently produces results intermediate between those of
the LDA and PBE functionals. 
 therefore expect that the
PBEsol functional would result in similarly reliable, intermediate surface properties for the nine novel hybrid catalysts. 
We thus performed all of our subsequent calculations using the
PBEsol functional.

the most stable heterostructure always exhibits close-packed

We next calculated the surface energies of the nine novel
catalysts using the optimized heterostructures as input
geometries.

assume that a heterostructure with a metal monolayer on a
TMC substrate could be realized by cleaving another
heterostructure with N (e.

that have already been deposited on the TMC substrate.

catalyst and pure metal formed upon cleavage.

slab. 
 7 contains a factor of 1/4 rather than of 1/2 for
the surface area term (A0) because four additional surfaces were
formed as a result of cleavage on both sides of the hybrid
catalyst slab. 
 surface energy of a heterostructure based on
eq 7 is the same as the cleavage or interface energy defined for
the interface between two dissimilar systems: one a pure metal
and the other a monolayer metal on a TMC substrate. 

Supporting Information provides a derivation showing that this
definition reduces to the conventional definition of surface
energy for a pure material, provided the slab model is
sufficiently thick. 
 tests given in the supplement
verify that our models meet this requirement, thus yielding a
unique definition of surface energy for our heterostructures. 
Table 2 reports the surface energies calculated using this
definition. 
The surface energies of these novel catalysts are significantly
smaller than those of pure TMC surfaces, which is to be
expected because the addition of a metal monolayer leads to
passivation of the dangling bonds at the TMC surfaces. 
Exposed metal atoms in a monolayer film have a surface energy
that is much lower than that of exposed carbon atoms with
localized dangling bonds.

23702Having calculated these 15 surface energies, we next explored
the correlation between the measured exchange current
densities, i0, and the computed surface energies.

illustrates the variation of i0 (on a logarithmic scale)18 with the
computed surface energies. 
 volcano-shaped correlation
between log(i0) and Esurf is clearly evident, similar to the
relation between log(i0) and the HBE shown in ref 18. 

peak of this volcano plot in this work corresponds to the
material with the highest experimental current density (in this
case, pure Pt). 
 peak is then referenced to the surface
energy of Pt. 
 surface energies of the other materials studied
in this work are then referenced to this Pt surface energy. 

resulting theoretical volcano plot is therefore uniquely specified. 
Two key features emerge from Figure 2: (i) the catalytic activity
peaks around the surface energy of Pt and (ii) surface energies
that are either too large (e. 
. 
 the TMCs) or too small (e. 
. 
 Au)
correspond to poor catalytic activities. 
 surface energies
generally correspond to higher surface chemical reactivities. 

This is in keeping with the notion of the surface energy being a
measure of the degree of coordinative unsaturation of a
material’s surface atoms. 
 systems with a large number of
coordinatively unsaturated atoms will be more reactive than
those with fewer such atoms. 
 unsaturated atoms
tend to bind intermediates too strongly, inhibiting their
subsequent transformation and/or release from the surface. 
This effect is an illustration of Sabatier’s principle: those
surfaces having either too weak or too strong an interaction
with reactive intermediates will demonstrate diminished
catalytic activity. 
 extent of this interaction is certainly
affected by the degree of coordinative unsaturation of the
surface atoms. 
Surface energy calculations require dramatically reduced
computational time compared to HBE calculations because of
the former’s reduced complexity. 
 HBE calculations
necessitate identification of the most stable binding site for H
on a surface. 
 this site has been determined, the binding
energy is then calculated. 
 calculations must also be
performed to ensure that a stable minimum was found and to
compute the free energy of adsorption. 
, expensive
supercell calculations are often necessary to account for
coverage variations. 
 contrast, surface energy calculations
involve only three calculations on surface unit cells: calculations
of the energies of the hybrid system and the two pure materials. 
The surface energy could therefore provide a more efficient
descriptor than the HBE for high-throughput computational
searches. 
 hypothesis was verified by calculating the surface
energies of six hybrid electrocatalysts with known current
densities, as shown in Figure 2. 
The experimental exchange current densities for Pt/Mo2C,
Pd/W2C, and Au/W2C hybrid catalysts have not yet been
measured. 
 “volcano” relation established in Figure 2 allows
us to predict their exchange current densities by relating their
computed surface energies to the “volcano” trend line. 

trend line suggests that Pt/Mo2C will be a better catalyst than Pd/
W2C or Au/W2C for the HER. 
, the surface energy of Pt/
Mo2C indicates that it could be a hybrid catalyst that exhibits
activity nearly identical to that of pure Pt. 
We also explored whether any similar correlation exists
between catalytic activity and other surface properties such as
the work function and the PZC. 
 investigation was inspired
by the finding several decades ago that the HER’s catalytic
activity correlated with the work function of metallic electrodes. 
 We therefore computed the work functions of the nine
hybrid monolayer metal/TMC catalysts (Table 2). 

variation of the experimental exchange current densities with
work functions of all 15 materials is displayed in Figure 3. 

used the predicted exchange current densities that were
extracted from Figure 2 for Pt/Mo2C, Pd/W2C, and Au/

 scatter in the data demonstrates no strong
correlation exists between current density and work function. 
Finally, we studied how solvation affects the surface energy
and the work function.

electrode−electrolyte interface is an “innocent” one, in which
water coexists but does not react or dissociate on the electrode
surface. 
 such interfaces, our volcano-shaped relation should
remain valid. 
 is in keeping with the experimental finding
that these hybrid systems are highly robust under electrochemical cycling. 
 inertness suggests that these surfaces are
negligibly affected by interaction with the bulk electrolyte. 
Tables S1 and S2 also once again show that the solvated surface
energies calculated with VASP are similar to the results
calculated by JDFTx. 
We also examined the potential correlation of the catalytic
activity with another important surface property of catalysts in
solution, namely, the PZC, which can be regarded as the “work
function” of an electrode immersed in a liquid. 
 “work
function” in solution is equal to the work function in vacuum
corrected by a potential drop at the electrode/liquid interface. 
In principle, we can use a periodically infinite surface slab with
implicit solvent to calculate the PZC. 
, convergence of
the calculation is slow. 
 practice, implicit cations/anions are
added to the simulation supercells by setting their ionic
concentrations, as implemented in both JDFTx and VASP. 
These ions induce Debye screening in the simulation supercell,
which guarantees that the electrostatic potential rapidly decays
to zero. 
 In this work, we set the total concentration of
monovalent ions to 1 M (0. 
 M H+ and 0. 
 M HSO4−) to
model the 0.

 To
demonstrate the effect of ions on the electrostatic potential,
Figure S2 displays the electrostatic potential profiles for the
WC(0001) surface in the absence and presence of ions in the
simulations. 
 thus verify that the electrostatic potential is
indeed zero outside the electrode if the ions are present in the
simulation. 
 zero potential far away represents an absolute
reference for the electrostatic potential. 
 added ions also
lead to a determinate electrostatic potential, and the PZC is the
negative of the calculated Fermi level of a solvated system as a
result. 
The calculated PZC of the metals and TMCs and of the
hybrid catalysts are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. 
Figure 3 also displays the variation of the experimental

current densities; therefore, neither electronic propertythe

catalytic activity as is the surface energy. 
■ CONCLUSIONS
We employed DFT to study the bulk and surface properties of
six common catalysts, including three elemental metals (Au, Pd,
and Pt) and three TMCs (WC, W2C, and Mo2C) using the
LDA, PBE, and PBEsol XC functionals. 
 showed that the
PBEsol functional consistently produces properties between
those of the LDA and PBE functionals and generally closest to
those of experiment. 
 therefore expect the PBEsol functional
to partially compensate for the shortcomings of the LDA and
PBE functionals. 
, the PBEsol functional gives rise to
lattice constants and work functions in excellent agreement
with experiment. 
 therefore employed only the PBEsol
functional to further investigate surface properties of nine novel
hybrid catalysts, each of which consists of one metal monolayer
on a TMC substrate. 
We explored the correlation between experimental catalytic
activity and three surface properties of 15 traditional and novel
catalysts: the surface energy, work function, and PZC. 

properties were selected for study because of their close
relationship with many properties thought to influence catalytic
activity. 
 discovered a strong volcano-shaped correlation
between the catalytic activity and the surface energy, indicating
that the surface energy can be used as a novel, efficient
descriptor of catalytic activity. 
 simple descriptor is
successful because it reflects the degree of coordinative
unsaturation of the surface atoms and thus the reactivity of
the surface. 
 validation of this new descriptor is
underway; HBE calculations to be reported elsewhere on,
e. 
. 
 Pt/MoC2, confirm its placement near the peak of the
volcano and its potential high activity for HER. 
 further
expect this descriptor could be useful beyond HER, to other
catalytic reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, but
verification of this speculation is the subject of future work. 
We also performed electrochemical simulations for the 15
materials based on JDFT. 
 found that the surface energy in
vacuum of these 15 materials is essentially unchanged by the
presence of an aqueous solution. 
 suggests that the vacuum
surface energy is a sufficiently accurate metric, provided the
water at the interface remains undissociated. 
, we
predicted the PZCs for most of the 15 catalysts, all of which
await experimental verification. 
 also confirmed the linear
relationship between the PZC and work function. 
,
unlike the surface energy, there exists no obvious correlation
between the catalytic activity and either the work function or
the PZC. 
 work thus identified an instructive indicator of
catalytic activity of the HER. 
 therefore propose that the
surface energy can be used as a descriptor to search for Ptefficient catalysts exhibiting surface energies similar to that of
the pure Pt surface.
